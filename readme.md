## Ishtaran


a skeleton fom a loadable Swing GUI app: it provides dual progress bar (1. for partial progress 2. for total progress): components are modulable via dependency injection (using guice), so you could provide your own implementation for progress bar, as well as for bottom textarea (now it is a simple unique textarea, acting as output console, but you could add dual, etc)
